This class implements following functions for arbitarily large number, of the scale 10^1000 by converting the number in higher base as opposed to the normal base 10 and then storing it in array with indices being the power of the base.
1) add
2) subtract
3) multiply
4) divide
5) modulus
6) power
7) squareRoot
8) evaluatePostfix
9) evaluateExp - using recursive descent parser
10) Num(String) - Constructor for Big integer passed as string
11) Num(long) - Constructor for Big integer passed as long number
12) printList - to print the number as array as descibed above with the base which it is represented in
13) toString - to represent the number in the base 10(decimal)

## Instructions to Run the Code ##

1) Make sure you open terminal outside of sxr170016
2) Now, run following command to compile the code.
   "javac .\sxv180069\Num.java"
3) Run following command to run the compiled code.
   "java sxv180069.Num"
4) If you want to run TestLP1, just replace Num with TestLP1 in command 2 and 3.
