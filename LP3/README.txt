The file contains code for Skip List, Red Black Tree, driver code to run them.

## Instruction to Run Code ##

1) Make sure you open terminal outside of sxv180069/ 

2) Now, run following command to compile the code.
   "javac .\sxv180069\SkipList.java"

   For Red-Black Tree
   "javac .\sxv180069\RedBlackTreeDriver.java"

   For comparison of Red-Black Tree and Tree Set you can use following driver code:
   "javac .\sxv180069\Comparison.java"

3) Run following command to run the compiled code.

   All three algorithms can be run using Comparison as follows:

   "java sxv180069.Comparison test-lp3/sk-t01.txt 1"
    or

   "java sxv180069.Comparison 4000000 2"

   Here, first number argument is the path to test file or size of the random numbers.
   The second number shows which method to run. 1 for TreeSet, 2 for SkipList, and empty for Red-Black Tree.



   Alternatively, you can also use RedBlackDriver

   "java sxv180069.RedBlackTreeDriver test-lp3/sk-t01.txt"


Please find associated report in report.pdf which shows comparison study.
